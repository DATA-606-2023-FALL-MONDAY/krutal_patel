## 2. Background

  ### A. What is the Project about?
   
    * This project is about data mining techniques on traffic and meteorological data to create a prediction model for accidents.
    
    * The study looks for trends and correlations that might assist in anticipating the risk of accidents by examining historical data regarding traffic patterns, road conditions, and meteorological conditions. 
    
    * The long-term objective is to develop a useful tool for enhancing traffic safety and maybe averting accidents through early warning systems or focused interventions.

  ### B. Why does it matter?

  #### ARE YOU DRIVING SAFE TODAY?

    * Road safety is one of the top most priority of everyone nowadays.

    * To make driving safer, the government invests billions of dollars in building excellent roads and certifying the safety of automobiles.
  
    * However, Thousands of accidents are happening after having strict rules and regulations.
  
    * Predicting accidents has thus developed into one of the most extensively studied areas, which could be used by various agencies to improve overall transportation infrastructure and optimize traffic conditions.

  ### C. What are your research questions?

    * What methods or techniques helps to achieve high accuracy in severity prediction and accidents?

    * How do these findings contribute to increasing roadway safety and reducing accident risks?

    * What kind of weather, road, and temperature could be a cause of an accident?
    
## 3. Data

* A number of publicly accessible datasets are available, including statistics on accidents, traffic incidents, and weather.

* These datasets could be used to prepare useful classification models to predict whether a particular condition is more prone to accidents and whether drivers must drive with precaution.
