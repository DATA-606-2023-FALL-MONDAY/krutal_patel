## Background
#### What is Accident About?

Ensuring safety, whether it pertains to health, finances, or road usage, remains a paramount concern. Presently, road safety takes precedence as we dedicate an average of 597 hours per year to our daily commute, equivalent to 25 days. Despite substantial government investments in constructing quality roads and certifying automobile safety, thousands of accidents persist despite stringent rules. The prediction of accidents has evolved into a highly researched domain, offering potential enhancements to transportation infrastructure and the optimization of traffic conditions.

The ultimate goal of my research is to create a robust prediction model that can anticipate the likelihood of accidents. This model could serve as a valuable tool for improving traffic safety by providing early warnings or targeted interventions. By combining insights from both traffic and meteorological data, I aim to contribute to accident prevention and enhance overall road safety measures. This forward-looking approach aligns with the broader objective of leveraging data-driven insights for the betterment of public safety and transportation systems.

#### Why Does Accident Prediction Matter?

The project involves the application of data mining techniques to analyze a comprehensive dataset that combines traffic and meteorological information. By delving into historical data, I aim to identify patterns and correlations that can contribute to the development of a predictive model for accidents. The variables under consideration include traffic patterns, road conditions, and meteorological factors, highlighting a holistic approach to understanding accident risk.

#### Research Questions

The primary research questions guiding Yelp Explorer are as follows:

    * What kind of weather, road, and temperature could cause an accident?
    - This question explores data visualization techniques to find out which conditions are best to predict accident prediction.

    * What methods or techniques help to achieve high accuracy in severity prediction and accidents?
    - This question uses different machine learning algorithms to find out which model performs well in this project.

    * How do these findings increase roadway safety and reduce accident risks?
    - This question explores how to increase roadway safety and how to avoid accidents or decrease severity.

## Data
#### Data Source


The accident prediction project utilizes the [UK Gov Website](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/road-accidents-and-safety-statistics), an extensive collection of data provided by the UK government for academic and research purposes. Specifically, one CSV files were used:

1. **`Accidents0514.csv`**

#### Data Size and Records

The size of the files is approximately 428.8 MB. The dataset encompasses a total of:

- **1504150 Total Accidents(rows)**: Representing individual accident on website.
- **33 Features(columns)**: Representing details of each accident.
